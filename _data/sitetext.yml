    Model simulations are essential tools for understanding weather and climate.
    As we adapt to our changing climate, simulation codes inform both our 
    understanding and policy decisions. These complex software artifacts are 
    often the result of multiple decades of development. And they are in a state
    of near-constant development as scientific capabilities advance and 
    high-performance computing (HPC) technologies evolve.


    Given the societal importance of these codes, maintaining confidence and 
    preserving code quality and reliability is critical. Yet scientific computing 
    applications are often developed without the use of extensive software 
    verification tools and techniques. Instead, development practices are typically 
    dominated by short-term concerns about performance, resources, and project 
    timelines.

    Technical challenges in running and evaluating climate and weather models
    further complicate code verification efforts. Given the scale of these models,
    a thorough correctness evaluation may be prohibitively expensive.
    It is also customary to require regression tests 
    to yield bitwise identical results. This requirement
    is often unmet due to the chaotic nature of climate and weather models and 
    large variety of hardware/software environments they are run on. When bitwise
    identical results cannot be sought, field experts are to evaluate model results
    in a time-consuming and subjective manner. 


    In short, climate and weather modeling communities are in need of practical
    and feasible means of ensuring correctness and reproducibility. 
    In this workshop, we aim to provide a venue to discuss challenges, opportunities,
    and recent advances in ensuring software correctness and reproducibility  
    for climate and weather modelers, HPC community members, and industry partners.


    
scope:
  title: "Scope"
  text: > 
        Topics of interest include but not limited to:
          - Tools and approaches for software testing, debugging, quality assurance, and continuous integration.
          - Statistical and ensemble-based approaches for evaluating model consistency and software correctness.
          - Software design approaches and development practices for streamlining correctness and reproducibility efforts.
          - Formal methods, abstraction, and logical proof techniques for rigorous verification.
          - Packaging, containerization, environment management, version control, distribution, documentation, and porting techniques for facilitating reproducibility.
          - Verifying and validating large-scale applications running on HPC clusters, cloud computing systems, heterogeneous systems, GPUs, etc.
          - Other software correctness and reproducibility approaches for facilitating verification and validation.

        Submissions may include technical results, approaches, experiences, and opinions 
        involving one or more of the above topics applied to:

          - Climate and weather simulation codes such as drivers, couplers, frameworks, and model components.
          - External libraries and packages used in climate and weather simulation applications.
          - Artificial intelligence techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, applied to climate and weather software.
          - Diagnostics, post-processing, visualization tools, and libraries.
          - Other software development and approaches extensively used within the climate and weather simulation context.
