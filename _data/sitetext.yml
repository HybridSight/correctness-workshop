    Model simulations are essential tools for understanding weather and climate.
    As we adapt to our changing climate, simulation codes inform both our 
    understanding and policy decisions. These complex software artifacts are 
    often the result of multiple decades of development. And they are in a state
    of near-constant development as scientific capabilities advance and 
    high-performance computing (HPC) technologies evolve.


    Given the societal importance of these codes, maintaining confidence and 
    preserving code quality and reliability is critical. Yet scientific computing 
    applications are often developed without the use of extensive software 
    verification tools and techniques. Instead, development practices are typically 
    dominated by short-term concerns about performance, resources, and project 
    timelines.

    Technical challenges in running and evaluating climate and weather models
    further complicate code verification efforts. Given the scale of these models,
    a thorough correctness evaluation may be prohibitively expensive.
    It is also customary to require regression tests 
    to yield bitwise identical results. This requirement
    is often unmet due to the chaotic nature of climate and weather models and 
    the large variety of hardware/software environments they are run on. When bitwise
    identical results cannot be sought, field experts are to evaluate model results
    in a time-consuming and subjective manner. 


    In short, climate and weather modeling communities are in need of
    practical and feasible means of ensuring correctness and
    reproducibility.  For example, we are interested in means to
    easily assess whether changes to a model code result in output
    that is systematically different or introduce artifacts that could
    influence scientific conclusions.  Such changes may include
    hardware or software stack infrastructure differences, replacing
    parts of the model with ML-routines, or applying data compression
    to the output data.  In this workshop, we aim to provide a venue
    to discuss challenges, opportunities, and recent advances in
    ensuring software correctness and reproducibility for climate and
    weather modelers, HPC community members, and industry partners.


    
scope:
