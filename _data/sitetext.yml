    Model simulations are essential tools for understanding weather and climate.
    Many of these models are the result of multiple years or even decades of development,
    which has resulted in large and complex code bases that are still continually 
    evolving. Indeed, most of these codes are in a state of near constant development, as 
    new scientific capabilities and processes are frequently added and ever-evolving 
    high-performance computing (HPC) technologies require code adaptations and further 
    optimizations. Repeated software verification is necessary during the development 
    life cycle to ensure that the changes made to the hardware and/or software environment
    do not inadvertently change the model results. For institutions like the National 
    Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), maintaining model confidence and preserving
    code quality and reliability is critical given the societal importance of these codes
    as we adapt to our changing climate. In fact, climate and weather model simulation
    output inform both our understanding and policy decisions in areas such as
    agriculture, public health, and extreme weather events

scope:
  title: "Scope"
  text: > 
        Topics of interest include but not limited to:
          - Tools and approaches for testing and debugging.
          - Statistical and ensemble-based approaches for evaluating model consistency and software correctness.
          - Software Design and Abstraction approaches.
          - Formal methods and logical proof techniques for rigorous verification.
          - Other software correctness tools and approaches for verification and validation.
          - Reproducilibity?

        Submissions may include technical results, novel techiques and approaches, experiences, ideas, and opinions 
        involving one or more of the above topics. Applications should involve:

          - Climate and weather simulation codes including drivers, couplers, frameworks, and model components.
          - External libraries and packages used in climate and weather simulation applications.
          - Diagnostics and post-processing tools/frameworks.
          - Cloud applications and containers.
          - Other software development and approaches extensively used within the climate and weather simulation context.
